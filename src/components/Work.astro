    <h4>Regenerative Agriculture</h4>
    <p>
      We restore soil health, boost biodiversity, and capture carbon through
      low-impact, outdoor cultivation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach goes beyond sustainability — it regenerates ecosystems,
      builds long-term productivity, and aligns with EU climate goals and
      conscious consumer demand.

    <h4>Pharmaceutical-Grade Cannabis</h4>
    <p>
      We grow fresh cannabis flowers with strict quality control, full
      traceability, and compliance with INFARMED and EU pharmaceutical
      standard.Patient and partner trust depends on consistency, safety, and
      regulatory alignment. Medical-grade cannabis demands precision at every
      stage.

    <h4>Agricultural Technology Integration</h4>
    <p>
      We apply digital tools and environmental sensors to monitor crops,
      forecast risks, and guide decisions through data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Technology increases efficiency, reduces waste, and ensures predictable,
      high-quality yields — critical in a regulated and competitive market.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Local Impact and Transparency</h4>
    <p>
      We create fair rural jobs, support circular economies, and share our
      results and practices openly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A modern farm should serve the land and its people. Transparency builds
      trust with investors, regulators, and the public.
